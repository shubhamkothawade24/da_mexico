# 🏙️ Mexico City Real Estate Price Prediction

## 📊 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting apartment prices in Mexico City using real estate listing data. It showcases a full data science lifecycle — from data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory analysis, and machine learning modeling to interactive deployment using Streamlit.

As part of this project, I approached the problem like a professional data scientist and project manager, tracking development using SDLC principles, identifying goals, timelines, and actionable outcomes.

## 🧠 Key Objectives
- Understand real estate pricing trends in Mexico City.
- Clean and preprocess large multi-source datasets.
- Engineer meaningful features for better model accuracy.
- Build and evaluate regression models to predict apartment prices.
- Deploy an interactive and interpretable prediction dashboard for users.

## 📉 Machine Learning Process

- **Model Chosen**: Linear Regression with Ridge regularization.
- **Features Used**: Surface area, latitude, longitude, and neighborhood.
- **Preprocessing**: Handled missing data using `SimpleImputer`, encoded categorical features using `OneHotEncoder`.
- **Evaluation**: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on baseline and improved predictions.

---

## 📌 Key Insights

- High property prices correlate with specific lat-lon clusters (premium zones).
- Surface area remains a strong feature, but geographical positioning greatly affects pricing.
- One-hot encoding of neighborhoods significantly improved model prediction.

---

## 🌟 Outcomes

- Built and trained an interpretable, end-to-end model.
- Created a working Streamlit app for users to predict property prices interactively.
- Demonstrated structured execution through SDLC: planning, building, and deployment.
